## Performance
You can disable any feature you don’t want to use while launching the add-on and the app uses very little resources, around 50-80mb Ram which is around 1 tab in Chrome. It has no effect on GPU and even when receiving data from poe.ninja, the effects on the CPU usage is very minimal and will not cause any performance issues.

## FAQ
DeadlyTrade is made based on 1920×1080 Windows Fullscreen Path of Exile. You can find other resolution’s config files in the installation folder.

Does the trading UI work with Kakao Users? No, it does not. Unfortunately right now there is no way to read messages from Kakao Client users with an addon because of legal/ToS issues.

I am getting a warning when i try to install. Are you trying to hack my computer? No, we are not. To prevent that warning from popping up we need to buy a license, which costs a lot of money. You can run the files through an antivirus if you wish to be safe about it. (Which you should, never trust a stranger on the internet.)

I got a suggestion/problem, how can i contact you? You can contact us via discord and github. We would be happy to listen to you. https://discord.gg/Gd7MjCz

## History
○ DeadlyTrade Overhaul Version Released Feb,2020

○ DeadlyTrade Renewal Version Started Jan,2020

○ DeadlyTrade Started and Sharing April,2019

○ POEExileDirection converted to DeadlyTrade in new empty Project 1year ago.

○ POEExileDirection developed in new empty hand and Released over 1year ago.

○ MercuryTrade KOR Version. (Origin. Exslims) All Korean UI&Functions Version Jun,2019 until Exslims no longer maintain officially.


### Behind...
It started from inspired Mercurytrade when I made and share Korean version of Mecurytrade. Addon name 'DeadlyTrade' also  inspired by 'MercuryTrade' including my respect to great exslims mercury trade ("Deadly"Crush + Mercury"Trade"). But All of my add-ons including this, DeadlyTrade, started empty handed, completely on my own and It comply with ggg's TOS.

I released DeadlyTrade beta version After the Mid-June, 2019 official launch of Kakao client. I forked and made Mercury Trade KOR version with Korean UI and every functions for Korean user and shared until great Exslims no longer maintain officially. I managed MercuryTrade KOR and Improving DeadlyTrade 0.1.0.1 over and over. And I prepared overhaul version after Exslim said officially that he will does not maintain.

### Build Passing, License, Contributor etc...
I got "Build Passing" with Travis CI, AppVeyor and other Sites. Travis CI and the others are hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects hosted at GitHub.
- Travis CI and the others are automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a GitHub repository that is using their pipeline and each time this happens, it will try to build the project and run tests. Especially considering the increasing number of add-ons, this should have a positive effect for everyone.
- Github Actions CI Passed. Real-Time connected.
- AppVeyor CI Passed. Real-Time connected.
- Azure Pipelines Passed. Real-Time connected.
- Travis CI Passed. Real-Time connected.
- Addition 1: Added License and Contributor Covenant, so we can work together under the License MIT and Contributor Covenent.
- Addition 2: When downloading or launching the program, you might get some warnings from your security or anti-virus program caused by missing licenses and signatures. I will add an international signature to fix that. SSH Certification is accepted and is being prepared for Code Signing. It will be done before next update.
![Certification](https://blogfiles.pstatic.net/MjAyMDAzMThfMTc4/MDAxNTg0NTM1MzA1Mzk5.JpNdWj4dgB1UqJO22eqnQUyYvw71TaF-tJFJRCYHkP4g.3gY0zbkV3voDwBxCV3fd-6pgPb_v7m6XBBC-bv9NLEUg.PNG.eocsdev2/Deadly_2020_0318_002.png)

# Thank you all. Good Luck Exile~!
Please let me know about any bugs you encounter or if you have any suggestions.
Thank you for your interest and support.

## Added - How to fix : Error by high security protection
Hello, this is DeadlyCursh.
I received a few bug-report and I was checked and figured out those case with reported user's log and configuration. Thank you for all users.

If you have repeated error please download "DeadlySecurityChecked_Dll.zip (Size 1.62Mb)" and unzip files.
And overwrite that to installed folder. download "DeadlySecurityChecked_exe_config.zip (Size 1.87Mb)" that contains lastest exe and defualt configuration file if you necessory.

exe or dll could be deleted by high security protection recently. So if in this case you should temporary pause virus protection program when download/extract. After that re-check downloaded files whether virus detected or not.

Thank you all. Exile. gl & hf.

"When downloading or launching the program, you might get some warnings from your security or anti-virus program caused by missing licenses and signatures. I will add an international signature to fix that. SSH Certification is accepted and is being prepared for Code Signing. It will be done before next update."

Update server, agile board, build passing, issue tracking and etc. all use my personal servers. Also international certification is delaying as it is conducted as an individual. I will proceed international certification ASAP.

I will restart maintenance add-on from now on.
I have been confused last two weeks about improve & sharing this add-on. So, I took a break time with my family.

Fortunately, I feel much better than lask week. This add-on that hobby for me (like a I was deployed WOW original add-on before.) so I didnt not code professional like a my IT working field before overhauled.

But, It's small ugly add-on was growed up with yours, and I feel somthing like duty whatever when it's growing up.

Anyway I will keep maintenance, improvement this add-on without consider that duty, user's wrong complain and the other weird users.

Thanks for waiting and patience. GL & HF
Stay healthy and have a nice day!
